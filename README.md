Javascript calculator for freecodecamp

This is mainly experimental, to get some good practice in for using github and git for my projects. This is some code that I've written for the JavaScript Calculator for freecodecamp.com. There is no actual JavaScript written yet, just some simple divs and design to get things running. I am practicing editing this code in Atom and then committing and pushing all of the changes onto Github. So far I've been blown away by what Git can do!
